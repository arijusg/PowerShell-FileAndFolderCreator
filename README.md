# PowerShell File And Folder Creator
The script create a VHD, formats it, and created set amount of folders/files. Originally I was testing FAT32 and NTFS file order (FAT32 file order will remain as they were created, while NTFS will be alphabetical)

### CreateVHD.bat
Request admin rights and runs VHDCreator.ps1

### TerminateVHD.bat
Requet admin rights and runs VHDTerminator.ps1
